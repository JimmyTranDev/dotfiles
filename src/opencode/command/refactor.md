Refactor, simplify, remove useless code, remove duplicate code.

Use the pragmatic agent to systematically improve the codebase by:

1. **Analyzing the current codebase** for improvement opportunities
2. **Removing code duplication** and extracting common functionality
3. **Simplifying complex logic** and reducing cognitive complexity
4. **Eliminating useless code** including unused imports, functions, and variables
5. **Fixing type errors** and improving type safety
6. **Removing legacy code** and backward compatibility shims
7. **Modernizing patterns** and updating to current best practices
8. **Optimizing imports** and dependency structure

The pragmatic agent will apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles to create cleaner, more maintainable code.

This command focuses on systematic code improvement through pragmatic refactoring that makes the codebase simpler, more reliable, and easier to understand while maintaining all existing functionality.
