description: Resume work from the previous session by analyzing recent commits and current state
---

Resume work from where you left off by analyzing your recent development activity:

1. Review the last 5-10 git commits to understand recent work context
2. Check for any uncommitted changes in the working directory
3. Look for TODO comments, FIXME notes, or incomplete implementations in recently modified files
4. Identify any failing tests or build issues that need attention
5. Check for any open issues or tasks mentioned in recent commit messages
6. Suggest next logical steps based on the development trajectory

This command helps you quickly get back into the flow of development by:
- Understanding what you were working on last
- Identifying any unfinished work or technical debt
- Suggesting immediate next actions
- Highlighting any urgent issues that need addressing

Perfect for starting a new coding session or after a break from the project.
