description: Implement tasks in parallel worktrees, merge all into an integration worktree resolving conflicts, and create a single PR
---

Usage: /pr-parallel <list of changes to implement>

Implement each task in its own parallel worktree, then merge all completed branches into a single integration worktree — resolving conflicts as they arise — and create one pull request containing the combined result.

$ARGUMENTS

Load the **git-worktree-workflow**, **git-workflows**, **git-conflict-resolution**, and **tool-todoist-cli** skills in parallel.

1. Parse the task list from `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - Split the input into individual change descriptions (separated by newlines, numbered lists, commas, or semicolons)
   - Each item is a discrete unit of work
   - If only one item is detected, notify the user and suggest using `/pr` instead, then stop

2. Determine the base branch using the priority order from the **git-workflows** skill (`develop` > `main` > `master`)

3. Derive branch names:
   - **Integration branch**: a kebab-case name summarizing the overall goal (e.g., `feat-user-settings-overhaul`)
   - **Task branches**: one per task, prefixed with the integration branch name and a short task suffix (e.g., `feat-user-settings-overhaul--add-theme-picker`, `feat-user-settings-overhaul--fix-email-validation`). Use `--` as the separator between integration prefix and task suffix.

4. Check for uncommitted changes (run in parallel):
   - `git status --porcelain`
   - `git diff --cached --stat`

5. If there are staged or unstaged changes:
   - Stash them with `git stash push -m "pr-parallel-stash"`

6. Create the integration worktree from the base branch:
   - `git worktree add ~/Programming/wcreated/<integration-branch> -b <integration-branch>`

7. Create all task worktrees in parallel (one per task):
   - For each task: `git worktree add ~/Programming/wcreated/<task-branch> -b <task-branch>`
   - If any worktree creation fails, report the error for that task and continue with the rest

8. Implement all tasks in parallel — launch a separate **general** agent for each task. Each agent works exclusively in its own worktree directory (`~/Programming/wcreated/<task-branch>/`):

   a. **Implement**: Apply the changes, stage, and commit:
      - `git add -A`
      - `git commit --no-verify -m "<type>(<scope>): <emoji> <description>"`
      - Multiple commits are fine if the task warrants it
      - Use the commit type/emoji mapping:

        | Key | Type | Emoji |
        |-----|------|-------|
        | `f` | `feat` | `✨` |
        | `F` | `fix` | `🐛` |
        | `c` | `chore` | `🔧` |
        | `r` | `refactor` | `🔨` |
        | `d` | `docs` | `📚` |
        | `s` | `style` | `💎` |
        | `t` | `test` | `🧪` |
        | `p` | `perf` | `🚀` |
        | `b` | `build` | `📦` |
        | `a` | `ci` | `👷` |
        | `R` | `revert` | `⏪` |

   b. **Review**: Launch **reviewer** and **auditor** agents in parallel on the diff from `git diff <base-branch>...HEAD`

   c. **Fix**: If issues were found, launch **fixer** to address them, then stage and commit: `git add -A && git commit --no-verify -m "fix: 🐛 address review and audit findings"`. Run **reviewer** once more to verify (max 2 iterations).

   d. **Merge into integration**: Acquire a sequential lock on the integration worktree (`~/Programming/wcreated/<integration-branch>/`) and merge:
      - Run `git merge <task-branch> --no-ff -m "chore: 🔧 merge <task-branch>"` in the integration worktree
      - If the merge has conflicts, resolve using the **git-conflict-resolution** skill — combine both changes where possible, ask the user when ambiguous, never silently drop code
      - If the merge is catastrophically broken, abort with `git merge --abort`, skip this task, and report it
      - After a successful merge, run a quick build/lint check if available to catch integration issues early
      - Release the lock so the next completed task can merge

   e. **Report back**: Return the task branch name, commit count, a one-line summary of what was done, merge status, and success/failure

   Each agent works exclusively in its own worktree for implementation, and acquires a sequential lock on the integration worktree only for the merge step. A failure in one task does not block others.

9. Collect results from all parallel agents. If all tasks failed, report the failures and stop.

10. **Integration review**: Launch **reviewer**, **auditor**, and **tester** agents in parallel on the full combined diff (`git diff <base-branch>...HEAD`) in the integration worktree. If issues are found, launch **fixer** to address them, stage and commit, then run **reviewer** once more to verify (max 2 iterations).

11. Run pre-commit hooks: `git hook run pre-commit` in the integration worktree. If hooks modify files, stage and commit: `git add -A && git commit --no-verify -m "style: 💎 apply pre-commit hook fixes"`. If hooks fail with errors, launch **fixer** to address them, then re-run.

12. Push the integration branch:
    - `git push -u origin <integration-branch>`

13. Create the PR with `gh pr create` targeting the base branch:
    - Title: a concise summary of the overall goal
    - Body: a summary section, followed by a checklist of all tasks with their status (checked if merged successfully, unchecked with a note if skipped due to conflicts). Include the task branch names as references.

14. Report outcome to the user:
    - PR URL
    - Table showing each task, its task branch, merge status (merged / skipped / failed), and conflict summary if any
    - Count of tasks merged vs skipped vs failed
    - If changes were stashed in step 5, remind the user to `git stash pop` in the main repo

Important:
- Task implementation is fully parallel — each task gets its own worktree and agent
- The integration worktree is the single point where all parallel work converges
- Merges into the integration worktree happen sequentially to allow orderly conflict resolution
- A failure in one task does not block others — failed tasks are skipped during integration
- If a merge conflict cannot be resolved, that task branch is skipped and reported — the PR proceeds with the remaining tasks
- Never silently drop code from either side during conflict resolution
