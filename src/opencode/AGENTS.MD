## Critical Code Writing Rule
**NO COMMENTS POLICY**: When writing, modifying, or generating code, do NOT add any comments. Write clean, self-documenting code with clear variable names, function names, and code structure that makes the intent obvious without explanatory comments. Comments clutter code, become outdated, and can mislead. Focus on readability through code structure, not comments.
