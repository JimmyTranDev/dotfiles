Review my staged changes and create a well-formatted git commit with:
- An emoji prefix matching the type of change (✨ feat, 🐛 fix, 📝 docs, ♻️ refactor, etc.)
- A clear, concise commit message following conventional commits format
- The standard Claude Code co-author footer

Analyze the git diff to understand the changes, then create the commit.
